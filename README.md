## DISCONTINUED

Unfortunately, Grank was forced to be removed and discontinued, for everyone out there who still wants to use it, the final version will be listed on here. All credits go to https://github.com/didlly.

## What is Grank?

Grank is a feature-rich script that automatically grinds Dank Memer for you. It is inspired by [dankgrinder](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder). Since dankgrinder has been discontinued and the [recommended fork](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/dankgrinder) has also been discontinued, I decided to make my own version from scratch in Python.

## Features

* Supports multi-instancing.

* Efficiently coded.

* Smart - if the user doesn't have a required item to run a command like ```pls dig```, it will buy the required item so long as there are sufficient funds in the user's wallet & bank.
* Autotrade - the self-bot automates the acception of the trade on both the side of the trader and the trade receiver.
* Typing indicator.
* Detects special events like `Dodge the fireball`.
* Custom commands.
* Autovote.

## Supported commands

* ```pls beg```
* ```pls blackjack```
* ```pls crime```
* ```pls daily```
* ```pls dig```
* ```pls fish```
* ```pls guess```
* ```pls highlow```
* ```pls hunt```
* ```pls lottery```
* ```pls postmeme```
* ```pls search```
* ```pls snakeeyes```
* ```pls stream```
* ```pls trivia```

## Todo

* [x] Add `pls daily`
* [x] Add `pls beg`

* [x] Add auto trade.
* [x] Add shifts.

## Getting Started

To use Grank, please download the ZIP from [here](https://github.com/kyan27a/Grank-Discontinued/blob/main/grank-final.zip)

### Setting up the environment

#### Windows

Download the latest version of Grank from [here](https://github.com/kyan27a/Grank-Discontinued/releases)

#### macOS and Linux

Unfortunately, I do not have access to a Mac or Linux device, so you will have to run the program from the source code.

* Install the latest version of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to have the `Install Pip` option ticked.
* Download and extract the latest version of Grank from [here](https://github.com/kyan27a/Grank-Discontinued/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
* Navigate into `/src`.
* Run `python installer.py`.

### Getting your Discord token and channel ID

To use Grank, you will have to provide your Discord token and a channel ID. Don't worry - these details are never shared with anyone. It is best if only you and Dank Memer can send messages in the channel you get the ID of. This is to avoid confusion with other people's interactions.

#### How do you get this information

* [Useful article on how to get your Discord token.](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token)

* [Useful article on how to get a channel ID.](https://docs.statbot.net/docs/faq/general/how-find-id/)

#### How to enter them

Since Grank supports multi-instancing, for every `token` you put in you will have to specify a `channel_id`. Open `src/credentials.json`. You should see a dictionary with two keys * `tokens` and `channel_ids`. As mentioned earlier, for every `token` you put in the list of `tokens`, you need to put a `channel id` in the list of `channel ids`. You can add as many entries as you want. The file has been filled in with a dummy layout so you know how to input your data.

You are now ready to use the program. Run ```python main.py``` in a command prompt in the `/src/` directory to start the program (or if you are on Windows run `main.exe`). You do not have to have Discord open to run the program, so you can have the program running in the background while you do other things! Grank also supports multi-instancing, so you can run the program on different accounts at once!

### ```typing indicator``` category

Values in the ```typing indicator``` category tell the program whether to make Discord think the self-bot is typing, and for how long it should. This is just for aesthetics and I would recommend it to be *off in private servers* to increase command speed, and *on in public servers* to make the self-bot look more legitimate.

| ```enabled```  | ```Boolean``` | ```False```  | If this is set to ```True```, the program will make Discord think the self-bot is typing. If it is set to ```False``` the program will not make Discord think the self-bot is typing, thus increasing command speed. |

### ```logging``` category

Values in the ```logging``` category tell the program whether or not to log *```debug```* and *```warning```* messages. We would recommend having *at least* ```warning``` set to ```True```. Fatal errors will be logged regardless of the configuration.

| Name  | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ```debug```  | ```Boolean``` | ```True```  | Tells the program whether or not to log ```debug``` messages. |
| ```warning```  | ```Boolean``` | ```True```  | Tells the program whether or not to log ```warning``` messages. |

***NOTE***: Values in the ```logging``` category do not affect logging messages sent when the configuration file is being loaded and the token is being verified.

## Disclaimer

This is a self-bot. Self-bots are against Discord's TOS. Automation of Dank Memer commands also breaks Dank Memer's rules. By using this program you acknowledge that I can take no responsibility for actions taken against you if you are caught.

This being said, I believe the chance of being caught running this script is low, provided you take the appropriate measures. The only probable way you will be caught is if someone tries to send you a message and you don't respond.
